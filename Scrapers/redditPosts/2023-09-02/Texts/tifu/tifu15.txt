    You're probably already trying to work out the logistics of how this happened. Let me explain.
  

    I was at work and needed to use the toilet for number 2s. When I went to pee whilst sitting on the seat, my tiny peepee perfectly lined up with the gap between the toilet seat and the porcelain. The pee leaked through like a tiny golden shower and fell on the outer ass part of my pants. I didn't notice this till it was already quite a bit wet.
  

    I had to do the walk of shame back to my desk, hiding my bottom from anyone around as much as I reasonably could. I can't stress the relief I felt when I finally got to my chair. I sat in it till I felt dry.
  

    Some poor soul is going to smell that seat one day and wonder how it smells like pee.
  

    TL;DR Peed on ass at work and now my office chair smells like pee.
