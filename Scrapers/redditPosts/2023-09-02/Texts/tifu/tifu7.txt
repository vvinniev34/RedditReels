    The actual TIFU happened last year, but today it manifested.

    For some important context, my fiancée is on the spectrum and we share a fairly abrasive sense of humour.

    Look, I don't know how to relay what happened in a nice and verbose journey through the kind of storytelling you're used to seeing on this sub.

    As per the title, last year I told her to be completely honest with me if I ever started gaining weight.

    This morning we were discussing the possibility to living in Japan for six months due to her job potentially requiring her assistance over there, when out of nowhere she slammed me with "my biggest concern is getting you over there without you getting harpooned."

    I understood what was happening, but was totally silent having just been suckerpunched over a stack of pancakes.

    She mistook that for me not understanding the joke, and started expanding on it.

    "It's because of the stereotype about the Japanese and all the whaling.
I'm saying you're a whale.
Whales are fat.
Get it?"

    She started howling at the joke and gave me a cuddle and I fake laughed and when she gets home I plan to explain to her lately what I meant about 'complete honesty'.
I do appreciate being told, but she misunderstood the assignment.

    Hopefully she isn't telling everyone at work that she called me a whale over breakfast.

    In any case, back to the gym I go.

    TL;DR: I told her to tell me if I ever started getting fat, she did so by calling me a whale out of the blue.
