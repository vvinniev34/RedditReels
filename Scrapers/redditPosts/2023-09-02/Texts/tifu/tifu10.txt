    Fml.
  

    10 years ago, I was falling for someone other than my partner. I kept it to myself and did not act upon it
  

    Leagues aside, I knew fine well it'd never happen. I allowed myself to drift away from that group of friends and from this person. It was for the best. I was over it. I doubt I've ever been the remotest hit on their radar. Honestly, I have no trouble accepting that.
  

    This evening I spent time with that person in mixed company, and all the old feelings were resurrected almost instantly. I was shaking as soon as I saw them. It'll never happen, I'm okay with thatn. But FFS 10 bastard years have gone by.
  

    We reminisced, talked, sang together although no time had passed by at all. I am 100% certain this person is not aware of how I feel, not do they feel the same way. That is absolutely fine, I expect nothing more.
  

    I can't do anything about it, I'm nearly 40 and have an acceptable existence. I wouldn't say I'm happy, but it's comfortable. No children involved.
  

    This person is like my kryptonite.
  

    If I posted this in AITA, I know the answer already. Just, damn. Damn, fuck and arseholes.
  

    I'm not into cheating, if they had asked me to see them home I'd have been honourable and no more. It's absolutely unreciprocated, and again, that's fine.
  

    TL;DR I have feelings for someone I shouldn't, 10 years after accepting my fate.
  

    EDIT - just a quick one to say I've read all of the comments, some very helpful and some very honest. Thanks everyone.
