    Tifu by making a porn movie without even realising I was in it! Obligatory, this didn't happen today or was several years ago.
  

    My story.  A long story.
  

    When I was 19, a young, dumb student I was out one night with friends and we had arranged to go back to a bar that our buddy was working in. He was going to be closing up that night by himself so we were going to back before closing time and drink all night in the pub with him. It's known as a "lock in" here.
  

    Anyway, I pulled a girl that night and she came back with us to the pub. Her and I and 5 of my mates. So we are all drinking in the back lounge of the pub. There's a pool table and juke box and we're all having fun. Things start to get hot and heavy with me and the girl so my mates, being good friends leave us alone in the lounge and move back to front bar. So we block the door and go at it fast and hard right there on the pool table. We were fairly drunk so it was pretty wild. Lots of position changes and theatrics. So after we finish up and get dressed, we head out to the bar, get a drink with the boys and act like nothing happened.
  

    This is where it gets funny.
  

    So I'm sitting on one side of the table with a couple of the boys and she's opposite me with her back to the bar. My mate who works there was standing behind the bar looking at me and without flinching he turns on the tv behind the bar.... On the tv is a pool table. It takes me a few seconds to realise that it's a live feed from the security camera in the lounge. All the boys erupt in laughter when they see my face change in realisation that they had all Sat at the bar and watched the whole show start to finish. He turns off the tv before the female lead saw the tv. She had no clue why every single one of them were falling over laughing. I had to get her out of there. So I made some shit excuse and got her outside and into a taxi. I went back inside and I Sat there with 5 of my best Friends and we laughed our asses off. We drank the night away and watched the video back, I gave my directers commentary and they gave their compliments and criticism. (I made sure the video was permanently deleted after).
  

    I realise now that I should have told the girl in question, but at the time I felt it was better to let sleeping dogs lie. I felt terrible for her after it but I made sure it was deleted. Young, dumb, full of cum and very drunk.
  

    TL;DR had drunk sex on a pool table with my friends watching the live feed.
  

    Edit : I didn't realise that you were all perfect and never did stupid shit when you were young and drunk. Stuff happened that shouldn't have happened. Can't change it now so that's why I look back and laugh at it.
