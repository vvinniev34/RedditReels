    Greetings Redditors.  Yesterday I learned about swaffelen, a Dutch term meaning to hit one's soft or semi-hard penis - often repeatedly - against an object or another person's body.  This struck me as amusing, and my wife has a nice round butt.  So, today, when we hopped in the shower, I asked if I could swaffel her ass.  I explained what it meant and she, being patient and with a good sense of humor herself, said okay, as long as she could try to hit me with her boobs.  I readily agreed.  Having never swaffeled anyone before, I really wound up my hips and gave my dong a good swing.  At which point I slipped and fell on my ass.
  

    I’m typing this from the ER, where I’m waiting to get an x-ray to see if my coccyx is broken.  Never got to slap my pud against that fine rump, or get slapped in the face by some titties.
  

    TL;DR:  Wound up an epic swaffel; wound up on my ass.
