    Pretty much the title.
I , 45f, and my pregnant daughter, 23f, were discussing the upcoming baby.
She asked me how hard breastfeeding was and I told her I never did.... She asked why and I told her the only 2 people I knew who breastfed complained about it constantly and it didn't seem worth the hassle, especially since her dad left me and I had to go to back to work 7 weeks after she was born, and I only got and extra week because week 6 was Christmas week.
She was upset and accused me of hiding this from her , I said it never came up?
So she's all mad and has a call into to her doctor to see if she is at a disadvantage because of this, and I should have " disclosed the facts" before she got pregnant so she knew she was " malnourished".
She was never malnourished!
She hit all her landmarks in infancy, was very healthy.
I think she is being ridiculous and she thinks I'm a total asshole.
AITA?
