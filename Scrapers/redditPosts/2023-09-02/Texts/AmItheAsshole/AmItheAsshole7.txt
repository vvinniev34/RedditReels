    My (26F) husband (29M) and I were invited at my ILs for dinner yesterday.

    Everything’s was going great until my MIL brought up my husband’s "player" phase in high school.

    My MIL was just jokingly being like "Honestly, him in High school, I’d never thought he’d actually settle down with somebody" and my FIL was like "Yeah, even less with someone like you".
I asked him what he meant by that

    Both my MIL and husband were then like "Please, no" in a "oh he’s gonna fuck up" way.

    My FIL said "Well you weren’t exactly his type in high school, you know?".
My husband tried to make him stop after that but my FIL added "Not saying you weren’t pretty enough or anything like that, you just wouldn’t have caught his eyes"

    I got up the table and went to the bathroom.
I was not even in there for 5 minutes that my husband knocked and told me we were leaving.

    Once we were home, my husband received a text from his mom saying that my reaction was childish and disrespectful and that we wouldn’t be invited again until i apologized.
My husband replied that I’d only apologize if my FIL apologize first.
He didn’t got an answer but his sister texted me that I needed to apologize ASAP because I was putting my husband’s relation with his parents at risk over a misunderstanding.
