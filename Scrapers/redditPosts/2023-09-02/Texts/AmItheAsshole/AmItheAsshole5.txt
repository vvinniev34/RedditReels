    
    AITA for taking back a shawl my wife made for a bride-to-be after she was uninvited from the wedding? 
  
My wife, Lena, crochets
a lot and often gifts
it to friends and
family.
When her 2nd oldest
brother got married, she
made the bride a shawl to
wear over her dress in the
evening.
The bride loved it and ever
since Lena has made shawls for
everyone in her family getting
married.
Now Lena’s oldest brother,
George, is getting married
again.
Lena doesn’t have a
relationship with George as
he was abusive to her as a
child, but if she has to see
him then she is polite but
distant with him.
She doesn’t want to cut off the
rest of her family because of
George.
I work with George and while we
aren’t friends, we are friendly
at work – Lena encouraged this,
when George got moved to my team
I was going to request a transfer
not wanting to expose Lena to
George as my team do a lot of get
togethers with our significant
others.
As it is a family wedding,
Lena’s mom asked her if she
could crochet a shawl for
George’s fiancee and Lena
agreed.
It was arranged that once it
was finished I would take it
to work to give to George so
that Lena didn’t have to see
him.
Earlier this week, the shawl
was completed and I emailed
George at work to let him
know that I would bring it in
today as the wedding is
tomorrow.
When I got into work this
morning, I gave George the shawl
and let him know that Lena and I
were looking forward to the
wedding.
Come lunch time, Lena called me
to let me know that George’s
fiancee had called her and told
her that she was no longer
invited to the wedding citing
the place they are having the
wedding and the reception at is
too small for the number they
have coming so are having to
make cut backs.
However I was still
invited to the
wedding.
I was mad at this because they
clearly only invited Lena to get
a shawl, which to me is just
rude.
If they had asked Lena outright to
make one, she probably would have
done because she loves to crochet.
On my way out of work, I
noticed George wasn’t at
his desk but the shawl
was.
I was still mad that they had
used Lena to get a shawl and I
just shoved it in my work bag.
I left a note on his desk
telling George since Lena was
no longer invited, the shawl
and I would no longer be
attending either.
On my way home, I told Lena
what I had done and asked her
if she wanted to go out
instead, so not to waste
having a sitter.
Lena was upset that I had
taken the shawl as it was
causing an uproar in her
family group chat where people
were calling her petty because
I took it back.
Lena wants me to give it back.
I don’t think I should, they
don’t deserve Lena’s
kindness.
However, at the same time, I
don’t want Lena to be upset
with me over George and a
shawl.
Am I the asshole for
taking back the
shawl?
Edit: I have messaged the group
chat, letting them know that I
took it and if they should be
pissed at anyone then it should
be me but I would also do it
again because no one gets to be a
dick to Lena.
