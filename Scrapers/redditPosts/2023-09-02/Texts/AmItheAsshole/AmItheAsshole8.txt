    
    AITA for letting my brother and family stay with me after a flooding but not my niece? 
  
I (37M) have been married to
my husband (41M) for 4 years.
I came out my family as bi when I
was 16 and from the very
beginning, they were nothing but
supportive and to this day,
almost my entire family accepts
me as who I am.
My niece (20F) is
the only
exception.
She is my brother‘s (43M)
daughter and despite her
parents showing no prejudices
against the LGBTQ+ community,
she doesn’t make a secret of
her homophobia.
I don‘t know where her
believes stem from but the
day I first introduced my
husband/ then boyfriend to
her family, she has been very
hostile towards us (she was
14 at the time).
She refuses to speak to my
husband, barely acknowledges
us at family gatherings and
despite her father constantly
chastising her, frequently
uses the f-slur to refer to
members of the LGBTQ+
community and calls same-sex
relationships disgusting.
Due to a severe flooding, my
brother and his family have
been forced to evacuate their
house.
My husband and I have a guest room
and a sofa bed in our living room
so when my brother asked we
whether his family could stay at
our place for a while, I told him
that him, his wife and their
younger children (15F, 12M) were
very welcome to stay as long as
they needed to, but that we
weren’t comfortable letting his
oldest daughter stay with us.
He seemed to have been
expecting that answer and
told me that he understood my
reasons.
When he broke the news to his
daughter, she was furious, asking
where else she was going to stay
and that she had nowhere else to
go.
From what I know, my brother
offered to help her pay for a
cheap hotel, but see doesn’t
want to dip into her savings
because she doesn’t work and
she‘s been living with my
brother rent free.
Apparently, she‘s been staying
with a friend for a few days
now and she‘s been telling her
mother how awful it is there.
My brother is still supporting
my decision, but his wife has
started trying to convince me
to let her eldest daughter move
in.
She‘s been pushing me to get over
her comments because my niece is
still "young and naïve" and that
she couldn’t have known her
actions would have major
consequences.
She‘s advising me to be the bigger
person and not let my "hard
feelings" for her daughter stop my
from helping a family member,
because that would be an "AH thing
to do".
