AITA for telling my sister that I was the "golden kid" because she couldn't do anything right? My sister was a mess, making my childhood miserable. She got involved with the wrong crowd and ran away multiple times, disrupting the peace at home. Despite being close in age, I was a well-behaved child. In 8th grade, I was allowed to hang out at the mall while my parents didn't trust my sister to do the same. At 17, they gave up on her, and I don't blame them. She even ruined my mom's wedding dress. At 18, she disappeared without being kicked out. Now, at 26, she has turned her life around, but my parents have set strict boundaries. I have been meeting up with her more often, but she recently went on a rant about not being invited to Thanksgiving because my parents don't feel comfortable letting her back into their home. After listening to her for at least 10 minutes, I had enough and told her that I was the "golden child" because she couldn't do anything right and that she is lucky anyone talks to her. She left in tears and her boyfriend called me, angry and calling me unfair. Edit: This thread has made me realize that I don't care about her reasons; she still did many awful things to me. It may explain her behavior, but it doesn't excuse it.
