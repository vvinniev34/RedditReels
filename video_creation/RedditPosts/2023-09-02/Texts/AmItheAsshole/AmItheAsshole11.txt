My sister is a flaming hot mess, she made my life miserable growing up.
She got in with the wrong crowd, ran away multiple times.
The house was never peaceful.
We are close in age, I was a pretty good kid.
When I was allowed to hang out at the mall in 8th grade my sister couldn’t since my parents didn’t trust her.
When she was 17 they gave up on her and I don’t blame them.
She ruined my moms wedding dress.
At 18 she was gone, they didn’t kick her out she just disappeared.
She is back and is now 26, she got her life together and my parent put strict boundaries with her.
I’ve been meeting up with her more often and she went on a huge rant about not being invited to thanksgiving since my parent said they aren’t at the point to let her back in their home.
After at least 10 minutes she went on about how I am the golden child and at this point I had enough.
I told her I was the golden child since she couldn’t do anything right and she is lucky anyone talks to her.
She has never apologized and she left in tears.
Her bf called me pissed and think I am an unfair asshole.
Edit: this thread has made me realize I don’t care what her reason was
she still did a ton of awful stuff to me.
It may explain why she acted that way but it doesn’t excuse it.
