AITA for blocking an Airbnb's view of my home? I've asked for legal advice already but I also want moral advice. Last year, we bought a historical property with a large plot of land. The previous owners operated it as a small hotel, but they couldn't keep up with it due to their age. We converted the property back into a private residence. There is a main country road running alongside our garden, so we decided to plant hedges for privacy and to prevent access, especially when my nephews visit and play football. There is a "gardener's cottage" at the edge of our property, which was sold separately when we bought our home. We made sure to keep any bushes on our side of the property line. Unbeknownst to us, the elderly couple sold the cottage to their relative, who planned to turn it into an Airbnb. We only learned about this when the owner noticed our hedges after a summer of growth. He, along with the couple, sent official-looking letters claiming that we were hindering their reasonable enjoyment of the property, as they had intended to market the cottage with "views of a historical landmark," which would be greatly diminished or completely obscured once our hedges reached full height. So, AITA for potentially damaging someone's income by planting these hedges?
