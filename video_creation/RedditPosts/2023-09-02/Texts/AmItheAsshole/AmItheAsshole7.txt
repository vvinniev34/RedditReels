AITA for leaving the table after what my FIL said?
My husband (29M) and I (26F) were invited to my ILs for dinner yesterday. Everything was going great until my MIL brought up my husband's "player" phase in high school. My MIL joked, saying, "Honestly, him in high school, I never thought he'd actually settle down with somebody." My FIL chimed in, saying, "Yeah, even less with someone like you." I asked him to clarify what he meant by that. Both my MIL and husband immediately reacted, saying, "Please, no," as if expecting my FIL to mess up the situation. My FIL then said, "Well, you weren't exactly his type in high school, you know? Not saying you weren't pretty enough or anything like that, you just wouldn't have caught his eyes." I immediately got up from the table and went to the bathroom. I was barely in there for five minutes when my husband knocked and told me we were leaving.
Once we were home, my husband received a text from his mom, stating that my reaction was childish and disrespectful and that we wouldn't be invited again until I apologized. In response, my husband told her that I would only apologize if my FIL apologized first. There was no response from his mom, but his sister texted me, urging me to apologize ASAP, claiming that I was jeopardizing my husband's relationship with his parents due to a misunderstanding.
