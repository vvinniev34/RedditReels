AITA for allowing my brother and his family to stay with me after a flood, but not my niece? I (37M) have been married to my husband (41M) for 4 years. I came out as bi when I was 16, and my family has been supportive ever since. However, my niece (20F) is the exception. Despite her parents being accepting, she is openly homophobic. She has been hostile towards my husband and me since we first introduced him to her family when she was 14. She refuses to speak to my husband and frequently uses slurs and derogatory language.

Recently, my brother and his family had to evacuate their home due to a severe flood. They asked if they could stay with us, and we welcomed them, except for my niece. I didn't feel comfortable having her stay with us due to her behavior. My brother understood my reasons, and despite my niece's anger, he offered to help her find somewhere else to stay.

Now, my brother's wife is pressuring me to let my niece move in, saying that she is still young and naive and didn't realize the consequences of her actions. She believes I should put aside my "hard feelings" and help a family member.

Am I the asshole for refusing to let my homophobic niece stay with us?
