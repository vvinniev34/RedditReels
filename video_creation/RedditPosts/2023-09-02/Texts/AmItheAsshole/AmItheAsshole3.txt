AITA for ending my childcare agreement with my sister because I don't want to care for her future stepkids, whom I have never met?

I (27f) am a stay-at-home mom to my two boys, aged 5 and 1. I also take care of my sister's two children, aged 8 and 6, after school and during summer break. She provides snacks for all the kids and pays me a small amount of money. I never asked for much because it was never a big deal to me, and I enjoy spending time with my niece and nephew. 

However, things have now changed. My sister is engaged, and her future husband, along with his two children, lives out of state. My sister has informed me that they hope I will take care of the stepkids as well. When I asked about meeting the children beforehand, my sister said they will fly in just before the wedding, and I would start caring for them right away.

I expressed that I would like to get to know the kids first. My sister's response was that they want to start off on the right path as a blended family, treating all the children equally. She insisted on them having the after-school time together. I understood her point, but I didn't feel comfortable taking care of kids for extended periods of time when I have barely met them. 

When I explained this to my sister, she asked why I couldn't just embrace the big change and throw myself into it. I told her that if she was willing to give me some time to get to know the kids, I might reconsider. However, she refused. So I firmly told her that she would need to find someone else to care for the kids.

In response, my sister accused me of considering only blood relatives as family. However, I explained to her that I would feel the same if my brother came back home after several years and asked me to watch his kids, whom I have never met, even though they are blood-related. It's not about blood relation for me; it's about having a close, existing relationship. 

AITA though?
