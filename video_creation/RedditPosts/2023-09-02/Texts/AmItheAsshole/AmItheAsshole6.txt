AITA for implying to my coworker that I "please myself" when my husband is away?

I've been at this company for two years. My coworker, John, and I have become good friends. We are both happily married and talk about life during work.

My husband has been on a business trip for two weeks. This morning, John and I were chatting and I mentioned that I've been alone at home and bored without my husband.

John asked how I pass the time and jokingly mentioned that I must be pent up without my husband. I jokingly replied that I know how to please myself when he's away. John seemed uncomfortable and we've been distant since.

Now, after a meeting with HR, I cleared up the misunderstanding and explained that I meant I can entertain myself. Interestingly, John didn't bring up his comment in the complaint and tried to cover it up by saying he meant I must be bored alone at home.

HR won't pursue a formal investigation but will keep everything on record. John will be moved to a different team temporarily. My manager apologized for being harsh earlier.

I won't be speaking to or interacting with John going forward. AITA?
