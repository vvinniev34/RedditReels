AITA for fainting at my aunt's wedding and ruining it? 

I attended my aunt's wedding a few weeks ago as a guest. Before the wedding, we were advised to stay hydrated and eat because it was going to be a hot day. However, I didn't have time to do either. 

When the wedding started at 5:00 pm, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the ceremony, I started feeling lightheaded and decided to excuse myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I felt like I was about to collapse and the next thing I knew, I woke up surrounded by people, including the bride and groom. Apparently, I had fainted and accidentally knocked into the photographer, causing his camera lens to break. 

I don't even remember seeing the photographer because I was too dizzy, but he was a family friend of the groom and only had one camera. The bride was upset because it was a cheaper wedding and she wouldn't have good pictures. The photographer offered to go home and get another camera, but it would have taken too long. 

Though the bride was mad at me, I feel it was harsh considering how embarrassing it was for me. Fainting had never even crossed my mind as a possibility. They were still able to get pictures on their cellphones, but I still wonder if I'm the asshole in this situation.
