    
    AITA for telling my sister her son is only special to her 
  
I (f26) have 3 older siblings.
This is about my
oldest sister “Abby”
(f37).
Abby has a son (5) and
I have a daughter (1).
Abby dealt with years of
fertility issues and had
probably 10+
miscarriages.
Then she had her son and of
course, he was Abby’s miracle
rainbow baby, we were so happy
for her.
But then it leads to Abby
spoiling her son and letting him
get away with everything because
he's a “miracle” and he's
“special”.
Everyone has always bit
their tongue when it comes
to her son because of
that.
On Saturday I had my
daughter’s first birthday
party.
It was mostly family and a few of
my close friends were invited I
invited Abby and her son because
everyone else in our family was
invited so I felt bad excluding
her.
We had different
activities for the kids
to do.
Abby’s son didn't
like any of them.
He was upset none of
the presents were for
him.
He didn't want to eat
any of the food we
had.
He then decided to try and
push the cake off the
table because apparently,
he was mad the cake wasn't
his.
I got super upset at Abby for
allowing her son to act that
way.
She went on to say
her son is special.
I said her son is only special
to her which is understandable.
But to everyone else, he's a
spoiled brat which shouldn't
be overlooked because he was
your special miracle baby.
Abby called me a
bitch and left
crying.
A few family members have
since called me an AH because
I've never dealt with a
miscarriage so I don't
understand how painful it was
for Abby to deal with years of
that before her son.
It's not that I don't realize her
son is special to her but it
doesn't give the excuse for Abby
to allow him to act like a spoiled
brat.
