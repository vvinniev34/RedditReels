AITA for telling my sister that her son is only special to her? 

I (f26) have three older siblings, and this is about my oldest sister, Abby (f37). Abby struggled with fertility issues for years, experiencing over 10 miscarriages. Finally, she had her son, who is her miracle rainbow baby, and naturally, we were all overjoyed for her. However, this has led Abby to spoil her son and let him get away with everything, simply because he's a "miracle" and "special." Due to this, everyone has always held their tongues when it comes to her son.

Last Saturday, I hosted my daughter's first birthday party, inviting mostly family and a few close friends. I decided to invite Abby and her son as well because I didn't want to exclude her. We had activities planned for the kids, but Abby's son didn't like any of them. He was upset that none of the gifts were for him and refused to eat any of the food we had prepared. Moreover, he even tried to push the cake off the table because it wasn't his cake. I became very upset with Abby for allowing her son to behave in such a manner.

In response, Abby argued that her son is special. I told her that he is only special to her, which is understandable. However, to everyone else, he comes across as a spoiled brat that should not be overlooked just because he is her special miracle baby. This remark caused Abby to call me a bitch and leave, in tears. Since then, a few family members have labeled me an AH because I have never experienced a miscarriage and therefore cannot understand Abby's pain throughout those years. My point, however, is not that I fail to acknowledge her son's specialness to her, but rather, it doesn't excuse Abby for permitting his spoiled behavior.
