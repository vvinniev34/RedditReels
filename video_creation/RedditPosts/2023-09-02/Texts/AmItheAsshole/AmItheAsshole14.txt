AITA for refusing to pay for my SIL and cancelling the vacation?

I (F28) have a great relationship with my niece Ava (F9). She loves me, and I love her. She has no issue staying with me for days on end, so I asked my brother if I can take her on a trip to Disney for a week. I knew she would love it, since we watch Disney movies together all the time.

He wanted me to ask SIL. She said they would let Ava go if SIL could come along too. I asked her if it was because she didn't trust me, but SIL said no, she just wanted to come with.

I told SIL she could come along if she paid her own way. She said she didn't have the money and that since I don't have kids or family, and have enough income, I should pay for her to come too.

I didn't like it. Technically, I have the money, but I didn't like the way she said it, and I have my own financial plans. I told her I wouldn't pay for her. In response, she said she wouldn't let Ava go.

Though disappointed, I cancelled the idea. The next day, my brother called me and asked why I cancelled the trip, mentioning that Ava was looking forward to it. (I hadn't told her about the trip)

I told him about my conversation with SIL. He was upset with SIL but didn't have the money to pay for her. He asked if I would cover the cost, but I said no, purely on principle. I felt SIL was forcing my hand, and I didn't like it.

Now my brother is calling me an AH for refusing to cover SIL and cancelling a vacation I never promised Ava.

AITA?
