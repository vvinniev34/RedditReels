    
    AITA for refusing to pay for SIL and cancelling the vacation? 
  
I (F28) have a  great relationship with my niece Ava (F9).
She loves me and I love her.
She has no issue staying with me for days on end.
So I asked my brother if I can take her on a trip with me
to Disney, for a week.
I knew she would love it since we watch Disney movies together all the time.
He wanted me to ask SIL.
Definitely.
She said they will let Ava go if SIL can come along with.
I asked her if it was because she didn't trust me.
SIL said no, she just wanted to come with.
I told SIL she can come along with as long as she pays her way.
We can all share the room, so she will have to get tickets (airplane) and her own ticket.
She said she didn't have money for it and since I don't have kids or family
and has enough income, I should pay for her to come too.
I didn't like it.
Technically, I have the money.
But I don't like the way she said it and I have my own financial plans.
I told her I won't pay for her.
She said she won't let Ava go.
Though disappointed, I cancelled the idea.
My brother called me next day asking why I cancelled the trip
and Ava was looking forward to it.
(I didn't tell her about the trip)
I told him my conversation with SIL.
He was upset with SIL but didn't have money to pay for her.
He asked if I would cover.
I said no, just on the principle.
I felt SIL was forcing my hand and I didn't like it.
Now my brother is calling me AH for refusing to cover SIL and cancelling a vacation I promised Ava.
(I didn't promise Ava)
AITA?
