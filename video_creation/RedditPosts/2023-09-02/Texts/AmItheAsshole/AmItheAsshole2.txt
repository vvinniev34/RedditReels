Am I the asshole for criticizing my daughter's father and his girlfriend's choice of name for their daughter? 
Here's some context: I became pregnant with my 10-year-old daughter after a drunken hook-up with a friend in my mid-20s. We decided to keep the child and co-parent as friends, without being in a romantic relationship. 
Four years ago, he started dating his long-term girlfriend, and they moved in together last year. When she got pregnant, I supported them as much as I could without overstepping boundaries. I encouraged my daughter to help out during her visits and to foster a close relationship with her sibling. I even offered to babysit so they could have alone time after the baby was born. 
I thought everything was going well and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling. However, three days ago when I met their baby for the first time, they had given her my daughter's name. I was shocked and confronted them about it. My friend's girlfriend dismissed my concerns, claiming it was just a pretty name. I asked if they planned to use a nickname or middle name, but she saw no need for it. I found this situation creepy and accused my friend of being spineless for going along with it. 
They told me to calm down and not overreact. My friend's father then took my daughter away, leaving me alone with them. I was labeled disruptive and asked to leave by the girlfriend. Maybe I reacted too strongly considering she had just given birth, but it still feels incredibly strange. 
I want to clarify that I understand they have the right to name their child as they wish. However, this particular name feels malicious and deliberate, as if they're trying to replace my daughter. The fact that they sprang it on us during our first meeting also adds to the weirdness.
