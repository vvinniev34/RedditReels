Am I the asshole for taking back the shawl my wife made for a bride-to-be after she was uninvited from the wedding? Lena, my wife, enjoys crocheting and often gifts her creations to friends and family. When her second oldest brother got married, she made the bride a shawl to wear in the evening. Since then, Lena has made shawls for all the family members who are getting married. Now her oldest brother, George, is getting married again. Despite Lena's troubled past with George, she remains polite but distant as she doesn't want to sever ties with the rest of her family. I work with George and, though not friends, we maintain a friendly relationship at work. When George got moved to my team, I initially wanted to request a transfer to avoid exposing Lena to him during work-related gatherings with significant others. However, due to the upcoming family wedding, Lena's mom asked Lena if she could crochet a shawl for George's fiancee, and Lena agreed. It was arranged that I would take the shawl to work and give it to George so Lena wouldn't have to see him. 
Recently, the shawl was completed, and I informed George via email that I would bring it to work today, as the wedding is tomorrow. When I arrived at work, I handed George the shawl and casually expressed Lena and my excitement about the wedding. However, during lunch, Lena called me to inform me that George's fiancee had uninvited her from the wedding, claiming that the venue was too small and they needed to make cutbacks. Surprisingly, I was still invited. I felt anger towards their disingenuous behavior, as it seemed they only invited Lena to secure a shawl, which I found rude. Had they simply asked Lena to make one, she probably would have agreed, as she loves crocheting. 
As I left work, I noticed George's absence but saw that the shawl remained at his desk. Still frustrated with their exploitative actions, I impulsively stuffed it into my bag. I left a note on George's desk, informing him that as Lena was no longer invited, neither the shawl nor I would be attending anymore. On my way home, I explained to Lena what I had done and suggested going out instead to avoid wasting our babysitter's time. However, Lena was upset that I had taken back the shawl, especially since it was causing a commotion in the family group chat, with people accusing her of being petty because I took it back. Lena wants me to return it, but I hesitated because I believe George and his fiancee don't deserve Lena's kindness. Nevertheless, I also don't want Lena to be upset with me over an issue involving George and a shawl. Am I the asshole for taking it back?
Edit: I messaged the group chat to inform them that I took it and if anyone should be angry, it should be me. I also said I would do it again because no one should mistreat Lena.
