AITA for peeing in my friend's shower? I (22FtM) stayed at my friend Natalie's (23F) place during spring break. Although we're just friends with no romantic or sexual feelings, it was our first time spending the night together. As someone without a penis, I can't pee standing up most of the time and prefer to sit. However, when I shower, I find it satisfying to pee and have it washed away. I assumed it was normal since my whole family does it. 

Recently, while hanging out with our friends, we started discussing peeing, including peeing in the shower. My penisless friends agreed with me, and even some with penises too. However, not everyone felt the same way, leading to an awkward silence. Later, Natalie nervously approached me and asked if I had peed in her shower, to which I admitted. She became quiet, and the situation grew uncomfortable. We avoided each other for the rest of the evening. 

One of our mutual friends texted me later, saying that Natalie was very uncomfortable and considering whether she would allow me to stay with her again. I immediately texted her, apologizing directly. However, I'm still awaiting her response. So, AITA for peeing in her shower? 

Edit: To the person who reported me as being in crisis, I'm just trying to pee here ðŸ˜­
