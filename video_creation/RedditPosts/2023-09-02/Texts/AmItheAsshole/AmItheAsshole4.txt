AITA for not disclosing to my daughter that she wasn't breastfed?

I, a 45-year-old woman, and my pregnant daughter, who is 23, were discussing the upcoming baby. She asked me about the difficulty of breastfeeding, and I told her that I never did it. She wanted to know why, and I explained that the only two people I knew who breastfed complained about it constantly, and it didn't seem worth the hassle, especially considering the circumstances. Her father left me, and I had to return to work seven weeks after she was born. I only got an extra week off because week 6 was Christmas week.

She became upset and accused me of hiding this information from her. I explained that it never came up before. Now, she's angry and has contacted her doctor to determine if she is at a disadvantage because of this, insisting that I should have disclosed the facts before she became pregnant so she knew she was malnourished. However, she was never malnourished. She reached all her milestones in infancy and was very healthy. I personally think she is being ridiculous, while she believes I am a total asshole. AITA?
