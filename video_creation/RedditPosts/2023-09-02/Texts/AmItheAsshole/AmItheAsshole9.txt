AITA for requiring guests to change clothes before sitting on my furniture?

I'm a 20-year-old guy, living alone, and I take pride in keeping a clean and organized home. Growing up, my mom always kept our house impeccably clean, and I've helped her for as long as I can remember.

Now that I have my own place, I've become increasingly aware of how many germs we track into our homes from outside. Personally, I always change out of my clothes as soon as I get home, but when I have guests over, they don't always follow suit. Considering I have no idea where they've been or what their clothes have been exposed to, it started bothering me.

As a solution, about a month ago, I purchased a bunch of clear disposable raincoats. I began informing people I invite over that they can bring a change of fresh clothes to switch into or wear one of the coats before sitting on my furniture. I even offered to wash their clothes that they change out of, if they want.

My girlfriend is fine with this arrangement and she started leaving clothes at my place. My mom and little sister have also been okay with the new rule. However, when I invited a friend over yesterday (I informed them about the clothes arrangement in advance), they were taken aback when they arrived. They said, "You must be kidding me." I assured them I was serious, and they ended up leaving without further contact since then.

Today, while discussing the incident with my mom, she implied that my requirement is excessive and unreasonable for everyone to follow. This made me start doubting myself. Am I in the wrong here?
