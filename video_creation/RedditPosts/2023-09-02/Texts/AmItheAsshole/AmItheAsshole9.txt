This is a throwaway.
I’m 20m and I live alone.
I’m a very neat person.
My mother kept our house pristine growing up and I helped her for as long as I can remember.
I recently moved out into my own place and something that I started thinking about was how many germs from outside we track into our houses.
I always change out of my clothes as soon as I get home but whenever I have guests they don’t.
And I have no idea where they’ve been or what their clothes have been exposed to.
About a month ago, I bought a bunch those clear disposable rain coats and I started telling people who I invited over that they could bring a change of fresh clothes to change into or wear one of the coats before they sit on my furniture.
I also offer to wash the clothes that they change out of
if they want to.
My girlfriend doesn’t have a problem with this and started just leaving clothes at my place.
My mom and my little sister have also been okay with this new rule.
But I invited a friend over yesterday (I told them about the clothes thing before they came) and when they got here they were surprised that I actually enforced it and said “You’ve got to f*cking with me”.
I told them no, I’m serious and then they left.
They haven’t been answering my messages either.
I was talking to my mom about it today and she said it was pretty excessive and unreasonable to expect everybody to do.
I disagree but Im kind of double guessing myself.
Am I in the wrong here?
