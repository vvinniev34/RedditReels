AITA for buying a car for my biological daughter, but not for my step-daughter? I made a deal with my daughter, Christina, that if she maintained a GPA above 3.9 throughout high school, I would buy her a car worth up to $20,000. She met the requirements and got the car. However, my step-daughter, Emily, now expects a car too, even though she has a GPA of 2.7 and prioritizes her Instagram over her schoolwork. I explained to her that the car was a reward for good grades, not a given. Later, I felt guilty and offered to buy her a car if she achieved a 3.9 GPA and got into an accredited college. However, my wife, Jenny, thinks I'm being unfair because Emily had a different upbringing and hasn't had the chance to develop a work ethic. She and Emily are upset with me, and I'm not sure how to handle the situation without straining my relationship with my family.
