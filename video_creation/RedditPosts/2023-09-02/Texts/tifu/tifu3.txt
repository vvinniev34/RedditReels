I work in a plastic surgery department and had seen a 17 y/o girl with her mother.
The girl very obviously had a deviated septum and before I confirmed the cause of the visit I EXTREMELY carelessly blurted out "nose?"
She was visibly embarrassed and held up her heavily bandaged finger.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
The girl had third degree friction burns on her fingers and had been referred to the plastic surgery department due to an ER visit.
She had a pyogenic granuloma form during the burn healing process and when it bled it had initially been mistaken for arterial bleeding.
During the process of cleaning the wounds and properly dressing them I noticed her looking closely in the mirror behind her a lot.
So much that I think I may have actually caused self-confidence issues in someone already vulnerable to them.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and feel like a major major asshole.
TLDR, Assumed something about a patient and may have caused self-confidence issues.
EDIT, Yes, I did apologize and explained how deviated septums can be medically significant.
There will be a separate appointment for that.
