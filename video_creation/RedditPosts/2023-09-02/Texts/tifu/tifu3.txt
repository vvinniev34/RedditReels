TIFU by getting shot at by the Philippines Navy about ten years ago. We were living on an island in the southern Philippines at the time. Our friends invited us to sail to a remote island for a BBQ and drinks. They had a catamaran and we sailed our Hobie trimaran. To give the new couple some privacy and avoid their antics, we booked accommodation on the island. 
The afternoon went well, with lots of food and excessive drinking. After sunset, we decided to head back to our resort to leave the love birds alone. My wife asked me if I was okay and if I could find the resort in the pitch black darkness. Completely drunk, I confidently slurred that I could. 
As expected, we got lost after about an hour. I spotted some distant lights and headed towards them. Suddenly, a spotlight was directed at us, and we heard excited shouting from what we assumed was the shore. Despite my limited knowledge of the local language, nothing I shouted seemed to calm down the situation. 
To our horror, they started firing at us. My wife was crying, and I was terrified. Luckily, the shooting stopped, and a patrol boat approached us. Unbeknownst to us, we had ventured into a protected marine area near a naval base. We received a scolding and were sent on our way. The problem was, we had no idea where we were, where the resort was, or where our friends' boat was. After a few more hours, we stumbled upon their boat, woke them up, shared our adventure, and continued drinking. 
To this day, my wife is very cautious about sailing with me. TLDR: I got lost at sea, accidentally trespassed into a restricted area, and was shot at by the Philippines Navy.
