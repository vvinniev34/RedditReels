This is age old tale of a scammer doing what the do best and leaving someone this time me with nothing left.
So I work put in rural areas fixing farm equipment and it just so happened that today I was on a farm with very little phone signal
I was in the middle of changing a motor on a cow feeder when my phone rings.
I see it has the dial code for my area I answer and put it on loud speaker beside me.
I hear the guy say is the Mr.gentleman its your bank.
But then the phone signal goes and he's cut off he immediately rings back and says the same thing.
I say yes thats me I'm a little busy can I call back.
The man says there has been a large purchase outside of the town area that you live was this you and I said no that wasn't me.
He says oh ok well we should first cancel your card then I've sent you a security code can you read it back to me.
Now of course everyone sees how much of an absolute idiot I'm about to be because of course I read out the code the man instantly puts the phone down.
Now I very quickly realise what's happened.
I try to call my bank but of course this is when my phone decides yup not enough signal to ring anyone.
I jumped in the van and drove as fast as I could to find a phone signal to ring my bank it took me 3 minutes and it was too late.
I had 6.5k and that's all I have to live off to buy food pay rent and pay for my wedding that is in 2 month and in a 40 second conversation I've ruined my life.
I feel sick and all I can do is just hate myself for being the biggest idiot on the planet.
TL, DR answered a phone call and gave away a otp that has left me in the middle of the month with 0 to my name because I'm stupid.
