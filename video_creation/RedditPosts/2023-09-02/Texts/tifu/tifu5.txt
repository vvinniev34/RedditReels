TIFU by inadvertently conditioning myself while attempting to condition my dog, Sola. A trivial FU, yet intriguing...
Last year, I embarked on an experiment with my dog, Sola, to test if she could recognize specific songs rather than just general music.
During the summer, we established a routine. I would return from work at approximately 4:45, unwind with a beer and some YouTube, and then at 6:00, we would head to the dog park. Since she adores going there, I chose this as the setting for my experiment. Each day, while driving to the park, I would play the theme song from Taxi (a '70s sitcom that you should definitely check out if you're unfamiliar with it). Conveniently, the duration of the trip typically matched the length of the song. After a couple of months, I decided to put my hypothesis to the test. I played the song at an unusual time and, as I had hoped, Sola went wild. Amazing! Good girl, smart girl!
Our routine continued, and it became evident that she had associated the "Park Song" with our trips. Then, I noticed something else—she also seemed to understand what 6:00 meant. Since our timing was consistently on point, she started coming and pestering me at 5:50 every day. Impressive! Not only could she recognize songs, but she could also tell time. Very clever girl!
However, in the past couple of weeks, Sola has been experiencing a skin reaction, so we haven't been able to go to the park. Naturally, we are both disappointed about this. Yet, just now, as I was watching my daily YouTube videos, I absentmindedly started whistling the theme song from Taxi. I glanced at the clock—6:07. It suddenly dawned on me that I had also been humming the same song yesterday around the same time. Unexpected, to say the least!
TL;DR: I unintentionally taught my dog that the Taxi theme song signaled a trip to the park, and this always occurred at 6:00. Now, every day at that time, I find myself with that song stuck in my head.
