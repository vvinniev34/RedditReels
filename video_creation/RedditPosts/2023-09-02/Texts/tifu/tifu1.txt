TIFU by jokingly telling a girl she turned me gay. This happened a few hours ago, and my husband won't stop teasing me about it. Just to clarify, I'm a bisexual guy.

There's a Barnes and Noble that I go to semi-regularly. There's a cute girl named Megan who works there, and I used to have a crush on her years ago. We had similar interests in books and had a few polite conversations. Eventually, I mustered up the courage to ask her out, and she gave me her number. However, she let me down gently a few days later, so I avoided going back to that bookstore for a while. Eventually, the awkwardness wore off, and I started going back, but there was still some tension between us, or so I thought.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm now happily married to my wonderful husband, and Megan is still working at the bookstore. On this particular day, I went to the Barnes and Noble with my husband, and Megan happened to be there. Since she seemed busy, I didn't try to strike up a conversation with her. While my husband was browsing on the other side of the store, I was in the manga section (don't judge me). As I turned a corner, I nearly bumped into Megan. We apologized, laughed, and engaged in small talk about an upcoming book by Sarah J Maas.

At some point, Megan noticed my ring and congratulated me. I thanked her and then she seemed confused. "He?" she asked. And here's where I messed up. Trying to be funny, I said, "Yeah, when you rejected me, I thought I'd have better luck on the guy side, and it turns out I was right. So, thank you for turning me." I laughed, hoping she would pick up on my sarcasm, but she didn't. Instead, her face turned red, tears welled up in her eyes, and she quickly apologized before darting off into a side room.

I wanted to wait for her to come out so I could apologize for the joke, but after 15 minutes, it seemed clear that she wasn't coming out anytime soon. I found my husband, and we quickly left the store, with me sharing what had just happened. He laughed and jokingly called me a monster.

I think I may need to find a new bookstore.

TL;DR – I jokingly told a girl who rejected me that she turned me gay, which caused her to run away and cry in a side room.

Edit: This post blew up overnight, and apparently, it's already on TikTok! I wasn't expecting that at all. Just to clarify a few things: I am a 24-year-old guy. Also, I didn't mean to cause any emotional damage or hurt her. I was just trying to lighten the mood of an old situation that I thought she had moved on from. Megan and I never actually dated; we just talked for a few days, and when I asked her out to the county fair, she turned me down. She later admitted that she was nervous and decided to give dating a try but ultimately felt uncomfortable. We're not strangers, but we're not exactly friends either. The joke might have been inappropriate, but I genuinely didn't see it that way. I'm not upset about her rejecting me; it happened five years ago. Additionally, my husband and I have a healthy and open communication in our marriage, especially because we are polyamorous. So, please, keep any negative comments about my marriage to yourself. And no, we're not going to ask Megan for a threesome – you know who you are.
