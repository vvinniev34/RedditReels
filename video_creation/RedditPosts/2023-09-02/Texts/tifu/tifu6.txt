TIFU and lost all of my life savings because I'm stupid. This is an age-old tale of a scammer doing what they do best and leaving someone, this time me, with nothing.
I work in rural areas, fixing farm equipment. On this particular day, I was on a farm with very little phone signal. I was in the middle of changing a motor on a cow feeder when my phone rang. It displayed the dial code for my area, so I answered and put it on loudspeaker beside me. The person on the other end claimed to be from my bank, but before I could fully understand what they were saying, the phone signal cut off. They immediately called back, repeating their claim. I informed them that I was busy and asked if I could call them back later. The person mentioned a large purchase made outside of my town and asked if I had made it. I replied with a "no." They suggested cancelling my card and said they had sent me a security code that I needed to read back to them.
It is evident at this point just how much of a fool I am because, of course, I read out the code without hesitation. The caller immediately hung up. It quickly dawned on me what had just occurred. I desperately tried to call my bank, but my phone decided it didn't have enough signal to connect.
I leapt into my van and drove as fast as I could in search of a phone signal to contact my bank. It took me three minutes, but it was already too late. I had 6.5k, and that's all I had to live off of; to buy food, pay rent, and cover the expenses of my upcoming wedding in two months. In a mere 40-second conversation, I had completely ruined my life. I feel sick, and all I can do is hate myself for being the biggest idiot on the planet.
TL;DR: I answered a phone call and unknowingly gave away an OTP, leaving me with nothing in the middle of the month because of my stupidity.
