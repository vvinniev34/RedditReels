The most insignificant of all FU's, but interesting...
Last year I decided to try an experiment with my dog
Sola.
I wanted to see if she could recognize specific songs rather than just general music.
We got into a pretty steady routine through the summer.
I'd get home from work around 4, 45, sit and have a beer and watch some YouTube.
Then at 6, 00 we'd head up to the dog park.
She absolutely loves going there, so I picked this as the setup for my experiment.
Every day when we drove up the street to the park
I'd play the theme song from Taxi ('70s sitcom that you should watch if you haven't heard of it).
Conveniently, the trip to the park generally lasted the length of the song.
After a couple months of this, I made my first test.
At an unusual time, I started playing the song and as I'd hoped
Sola went nuts.
Awesome!
Good girl, clever girl!
We carry on like this and it's obvious that she gets the 'Park Song'.
Then I start noticing, she also knew what 6
00 meant.
We were so consistent in our timing every day
she started coming and pestering me at 5, 50 every day.
Ok, cool!
She can tell time too, very clever girl!
Past couple weeks, she's been having some kind of skin reaction
so we haven't been going to the park, we're both pretty bummed about it.
But just now, as I'm watching my YT dailies
I started whistling to myself, and realized that I was whistling the theme song from Taxi.
Look at the clock, 6, 07.
It then occurred to me I also had the same song my head yesterday around the same time.
Huh.
Didn't see that coming!
TL, DR, I taught my dog that the Taxi theme song meant going to the park
and that always happened at 6, 00.
Now I get that song stuck in my head at that time every day.
