    This happened about ten years ago.
At the time we lived on an island in the southern Philippines.

    Friends of ours invited us to sail together down to a more remote island and have a bbq and some drinks.
We sailed our Hobie trimaran and they sailed their catamaran.
As they were a “new” couple we decided to book some accommodation on the island so they could have some “alone” time together and to be frank we didn’t want to hear their antics.

    The afternoon progressed nicely much food was consumed and WAY to much alcohol.
After sunset we decided to head off to our resort and leave the two love birds alone.
My wife asked if I was ok and can I find the resort as it was pitch black and no moon.
Completely inebriated I of course puffed out my chest and slurred“of course”.

    Off we went into the pitch black and as you guessed we were completely lost.

    After about an hour I could see some distant lights and headed for them.
Next thing we know a spot light was trained on us and excited shouting came from what we assumed was the shore.
My Bisaya (the local language) is rudimentary at best and nothing I shouted back seemed to de escalate the excitement.

    Next thing they opened fire and you can imagine I’m shitting myself and my wife is crying.
Thankfully the shooting stopped and a patrol boat headed out to us.
Unbeknownst to us we had ventured into a protected marine area outside a naval base.
We were roundly scolded and sent on our way.
The only problem is we had no idea where we were, where the resort was or where our friends boat was.
After a few more hours we chanced on their boat, woke them up, kept drinking and told them of our adventure.
To this day my wife is VERY wary of sailing with me.

    TLDR: Got lost at seas and accidentally trespassed into a restricted area and got shot at by the Philippines Navy.
