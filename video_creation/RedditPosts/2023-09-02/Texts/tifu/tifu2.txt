TIFU by asking my fiancée to be honest with me about weight gain. This happened last year, but today it came up again. Some important context: my fiancée is on the spectrum and we both have a sarcastic sense of humor.

I'll cut to the chase - last year, I told her to be completely honest if I started gaining weight. This morning, while discussing the possibility of living in Japan for six months, she surprised me with a comment. She said, "my biggest concern is getting you over there without you getting harpooned." I didn't respond, still in shock from her remark.

She mistook my silence as not understanding the joke and continued explaining it. "It's because of the stereotype about the Japanese and whaling. I'm calling you a whale because you'd be fat. Get it?" She found the joke hilarious and hugged me. I faked a laugh, but I plan to clarify my request for "complete honesty" when she gets home. I appreciate her telling me, but she misunderstood.

I hope she doesn't share this story with everyone at work. Anyway, it's time for me to hit the gym.

TL;DR: I asked her to tell me if I gained weight, and she did so by calling me a whale out of the blue.
